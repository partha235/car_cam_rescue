### **1. PROJECT TITLE:**

**Smart Rescue Robot with Live Streaming and Vital Sign Monitoring Using ESP32-CAM and MAX30001**

---

### **2. AIM:**

To design and build a compact rescue robot capable of navigating through disaster zones, providing live video feed, gripping and rescuing individuals using a jaw mechanism, and monitoring their vital signs (ECG, heart rate, and respiration) using the MAX30001 sensor.
